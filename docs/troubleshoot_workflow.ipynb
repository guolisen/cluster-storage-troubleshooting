    "# Kubernetes Volume I/O Error Troubleshooting Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the workflow of `troubleshoot.py`, a comprehensive system designed to troubleshoot Kubernetes pod volume I/O failures. The system uses a phase-based approach with LangGraph frameworks to systematically identify and resolve storage issues in Kubernetes clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The troubleshooting system consists of four distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase0**: Information Collection - Builds a Knowledge Graph with system information\n",
    "2. **Plan Phase**: Generates an Investigation Plan using rule-based and LLM approaches\n",
    "3. **Phase1**: ReAct Investigation - Executes the Investigation Plan to produce a Fix Plan\n",
    "4. **Phase2**: Remediation - Executes the Fix Plan to resolve identified issues\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide a clear understanding of each phase's purpose, components, and implementation, as well as visualize the workflow using Mermaid diagrams."
