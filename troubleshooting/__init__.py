Troubleshooting module for Kubernetes Volume Issues

This module provides troubleshooting functionality and LangGraph implementations
for comprehensive root cause analysis and fix plan generation in the CSI Baremetal
driver troubleshooting system.

The module has been refactored according to Martin Fowler's "Refactoring: Improving
the Design of Existing Code" principles to improve maintainability, readability,
and extensibility.
